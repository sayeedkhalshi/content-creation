Possibly the mathematics of human context, but that's not the best part. I have been called crazy my whole life. I will not say what great I did in my early life, rather I will talk about something that matters.

I have developed like a few hundred of theories. Many of them don't exist. They are unpublished, going to be open-sourced with a crazy project to make them upgradable inside the frameworks they live in. There are good reasons why I was able to do this kind of discovery. Also, they really help make better AI, too.

At a very early age, I started developing a robot brain. The initial reason was, I couldn't have managed all the information I know.

My parents were worried because I couldn't function physically and mentally very much. My perception by observation was very little. I couldn't even command my arms to pick up a thing without making a mess. I wasn't just dumb, I was also numb. Somehow, I read in the Quran, if you think about something, you will know things others can't even imagine.

So I went to the garden and started looking at the leaves. I looked for half an hour, I remember doing that for like a week, and eventually I started finding more information, like colors, sprinkles, etc. When I asked my father about what I found, he told me about photosynthesis. It kept inspiring me. I started building ideas on my clean slate. Here is the crazy part, I felt I was consciously connecting the ideas and would remember every detail I learn and thought of.

The greatest ways to train my brain were to read terribly written books and try to make sense of them, looking at nothing and figuring out more, attempting to connect the dots. It wasn't beautifully written harmony that triggers hormonal flows through feelings and pattern magic; it was weirdness. Now I understand that's what scientists are.

But there were crazy parts too, every word or sentence I read that I haven't faced in life yet, I would go out and face it, experience it, and then connect that experience to all other learning to upgrade my whole concept. Then I came back to reading again.

Terrible that keeping all the information, building concept out of them, and then generating new ideas out of them was very conscious to me. Along with I figured out a lot of things while practicing those experiences in a social context.

I would do 3-4 hours of exercise regularly, then read, then practice. My perception became so sharp, I remember the phases where I could see things in slow motion. And this was for a few good years in a row.

But it didn't last long; I couldn't do it since my brain couldn't take it anymore, as I stopped regular exercise due to other physical complexities.

In that time, I had to stop reading. I couldn't even look at a book. I was too burned out. I grew from childhood to 10th grade with conscious learning, analyzing them, this was too much, and I was only able to do it for so long because I exercised physically really hard and had energies you can't imagine.

Anyway, when I couldn't learn anymore, I started the idea of an AI brain that could do those kinds of concept building and generating, since an AI brain wouldn't be weak like humans and could do a lot more than I could.

After the first few attempts, I found my knowledge is very limited about how human learns, so I am unable to create a good concept of AI even in a paper.

I started learning how the human brain works. Deep diving into thoughts, I evolved through many ideas later years. There was no internet, and the only library accessible to me was full of novels, stories, and religious books.

So I kept thinking and writing. Though earlier I already had the idea of concept, bias, and generating, funny now they don't have a place in my framework. Neither did I use things from established psychology.

My first genuine idea was that Humans are a Learning Machine, and Force Learning is what we unknowingly do. If our brain is learning automatically, why do we have to tell our brain and force it to learn? Though I wrote many theories in between, the answer to this question came very last. In Game theory, we learn how we have to decide, but my question is why, and who recommends that you to decide this? That's where 'how we learn' is. Only if you could understand the chain of recommended flows in you, you would be surprised.

The answer is really complex. To simplify, there is no action if there is no flow. Flow(imagine wind flowing) is like a narrative in a human context; it has continuity, direction, momentum, speed, etc. (Artificially neuron groups could have similar properties.) That narrative predicts our next action, but the decision to take action depends on the care scale, the amount of care you have for it. This is why I feel, care builds the whole economy.

It took me half of my life to reach a conclusion of how we learn and how our social context is built. Our actions, interactions all have precise frameworks to describe them universally. After I had the initial idea of completing the frameworks and finalizing the idea of the book I am writing on it, I started learning mathematics 2 months ago. Finally, I am looking forward to learn the mathematics behind AI and, if possible, implement my theories to make an AI.

While learning mathematics in ast two months I learned, control theory already exists, godels completness theory already exists though they are in totally different context.

Last 3 years I didn't do any job or other works, I was living on the savings from dev jobs. I was working on these ideas for full time. I am hoping to join SSI and make the next move of my career to build an AI for humanity. Right now my learning theories can be used to build the frontend product to help people learn better in a universal learning system using AI, but also my AI ideas needs to be sharpened and hopefully we will build the first AGI.
