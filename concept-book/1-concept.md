What Is Intelligence Actually? I do not expect you to understand this initial chapter called "concept". But if you do, you will see, it's a attempt to connect all those theories I have, not to explain those theories. I meant the bigger picture first, the

## What Is Intentional Being?

Anything has some rule is a structure. Universe is a set with things. We built the whole world on this idea. But often we forget a structure also has some properties other than just rules.Then along with physical properties we see, we can observe some phenomena's that we can't see but we know they are there. Those only observable properties are seen by human context or in our mind. But their existence is beyond us.

Some of those properties are changes, movements, momentum, flows, frequency, waves etc.

The rule is interactions and changes appeared on that. But changes aren't just translations. They were not convertion exactly. And changes may occur that specific physical properties on that object didn't exist anymore.

In a sense, this change is the learning for the objects that have no control over their existence being faded. Stability is called a change that happens really slowly. But for a non intentional object it was nothing important to exist or not exist.

When intentional beings appeard in the universe, they had this problem with changes. They wanted to predict the outcome of the changes so they don't go extinct. They came with a intention to survive.

Intention comes from commitment for an intentional being. A commitment is basically a way to give importance to a future. Basically betting on a future, which you can say betting on nothing. So forcing on that nothing is our usual nature and this is how the idea of Force learning emerges.

The commitment itself is built on the idea of predictibility. It depends on the outcome of our prediction.

You see the world is changes based on the rule of interactions. Those changes emerges as they seem random and unpredictible. In micro and micro scale, we have two way developed for this, one is to look for flows (unseen observable properties), other is to look for changes (seen and objectifiable).

Flow is the way to see all scale how easily changes are predictable and pattern emerges. But if you look at changes directly, it will feel chaos.

For intentional being, flows can be obeserved. But when used in a thought or wording, it becomes a narrative like from a story. That's the difference. When some poet said the universe is made of stories not atoms, I still wonder if he was thinking this.

Now looking at patterns, we see how we can develop predictibility, by using both.

Patterns seeking on flows and changes give us predictibility on randomness. We keep seeking until the prediction has a positive outcome. That pattern seeking is one form 'learning'.

When a outcome of prediction is negative, we don't do that thing. If we do, we have a thing call anxiety. Anxiety itself is the intitial driver of intentional being, cause it creates the force to have a commitment to learn. But in secondary phase, it itself a driver of learning still.

Don't just think the flows of learning for intentional beings are different naively cause there are all other kind of flows to look at in the universe. Flows have physics properties like wave, frquencies, speed, velocity, momentum or human context properties like narratives, continuity, story, perspectives and characters. For an intentional being, flow is smoothness of actions. But it's hard to get on a flow and it's hard to get off a flow. Because you have to learn it to get on a flow, just commitment, which is betting on a nothing future doesn't give us acknowledgements.

Before learning, a pattern seeker, wouldn't just learn a thing because the information is there. It has a big main flow, whose job is to check for a few things, one of the first is to check for 'continuity' of the personal narrative or continuity of the main flow. Secod thing, is filter the information to only what's necessary, third is reshape the information to fit the narrative, fourth, there is another flow it feeds which 'learns how to learn. That fourth part has two thing, one is it learns how to learn that particular thing it's learning and then it learns how to learn universally for all (I couldn't verify if it's the learning technique for main flow). That how to learn technique development is what I call learning technique. For each thing. Optionally some really smart brain can have seperate learning techniques for each and can update each seperately, which I see has a big conflict with the other theories that completed the whole learning cycle.

Main flow is the main big thing whose job is to filter, query, acknowledge, deny etc all the decision making part. In a normal sense the main flow follows the action-projection framework.

Before we took an action, we do a prediction from our desired story from our own narrative of the main flow. Then we project the idea mentally, to check, update, verify the to see it in visualization. Then, we acknoeledge and deny based on the predictiblity of positiveness of that projection. If the prediction is positive, we acknowledge it and the idea starts processing in our brain. That's Primary acknowledgement of our predictions. Then we have a care scale. Based on the care scale, we go to action of that work. Then we again project the idea, filter reshape, then we reprogress with secondary ackowledgements. Remeber after each acknowledgement and denial, we might take a rest or do other things in between, still mapping the prediction. Then we move on to action again.

But this cycle keeps going. You see our brain is weak. It works on limit. It has limitation for eveything. So similar to nature, our brain works using resets, cycles and phases. In the last phase when the brain can't take anymore, and in the first phase when the brain is fresh to take an idea in. At one point our brain is overwhelmed and can't see more to do either because of tiredness and we start denial. That denial phase starts an immediate learing process inside our brain to process all the acknowledged thing. I call this learning process and all the acknowledged threads are learnign threads.

I call it Learning Breakup. When a brain stops learning a thing so a new cycle can start, so the brain can process the neuroplasticity without more information disturbing the process, it can update all the parts (learning pots) to fill. You see this phase can have partial processing if all the fields of reality pot aren't checked or answered. Now this reality pot is actually all the learning techniques developed that raises the question to validate any information accurately based on techniques to not have a negative prediction. Sometimes, negotiation happens, but that's not how we normally work.

So the learning techniques, threads, processes are all in the cycle of learning. But this cycle has more. More interesting phases are there, like care, narratives and etc.

When a information is processed we can call it a learning, cause after the breakup, suddenly we get some new ideas, which I call genuine ideas. Also I call them learning philosophy. Cause you can talk your own about it now. In one channel, this idea is ready to be evaluated and can't wait to be used to learn more. Cause this idea gets all the learning commitments naturally, it also gets a lot of pride. This learning pride helps us to used this idea to use in interactions mediums (the only rule to make use of the idea to build structures) like talk, write, share, create arts, build business, etc. This idea goes through same action prediction projection framework and learning cycles of reseting and overwheliming part.

## What's a control structure?

A control structure emerges from the need of positive predicbility. Anything we create automatically becomes a control structure because it's controlled to positive for intentional beings. It can be thoughts, materials, or flows. It can be anything. In and out of human context.

When a geuine idea emerges, it gets it pride, urges to make it a learning ground for the next learning. When someone is mocked or felt stupid, those idea never becomes a ground for new learning, those idea never to be thought cause they are PTSDed, thus their continuity of personal narrative breaks there and can't have their own opinion further in life for really long times. So we should let people share their stupid ideas and may need to face social and sincere reactions. This is the importance of social importance of a entities personhood should not be based on their skills and knowledge but their personhood and individualism. Cause the pride in a person is really intimidating for others.

Anyway when you have a genuine idea, it's already a mathematical translation from your thought language to your inner voice. Before that when you processed, you already faced the dilemma in the learning tehnique phase where you consciously tried to compare your thoughts, but because you had single state of mind, you couldn't do it properly. When you think of one thing you can't think of other thing, thats the phenomena in ouy brain. This our pattern matching and probablistic analysis is terrible and too biased. That's beacuse our main flow is really too baised. (The weight is really far from the truth). Also it goes through weeks, months, years or even decades of hidden flows or processes to verify the learning pot's questions over the life.

So passing all those dilemma, now you are in the dillemma that what you generated in the primary phulosophy loses a lot of value when it's in your thoughts and it decreases as it moves towards the inner voice. When you reall say it to the people, you see it doesn't fit in that situation. So you go throught he action prediction framework for a few times until you find the ground where your ideas can be recited. So that's Situational Leanirng Manipulation. After that when you start writing, you could see a lot of missing pieces. Then as you change interaction mediums, your idea keeps changing. That Manipulation Based on Learning Medium.

But social context is yet to come. Just because it's all control structure we control the outcome of our thoughts being expressed. But let's come back to this later (Also completing the learning cycles with flows, perspective, intentions, characters, story, narrative, care etc to come yet. Then also traps, hormones, purposes and emotions). First let's explore human context, social context and economics.

We think our economics includes only us trading over goods. But the real economics is beyond. It control structures we create and we trade control, this includes God, Spirits, Aliens, Humans, Other animals, microbioms, plants all. We trade control over each other and we use flows to control each other. For that reason, flows (usually unseen) are taboo in society (cause it feels secrets to make us mysterious and have edge on controling). It is implied as weird and strange talking about personal flows.

So if now we talk about the genuine idea paradox, is that, it always keeps changing until it hits society. When it hits society, it changes the tone to a control structure in social scale (Initially it's micro level social structure as our thoughts are created becasuse of the desire to control).

The idea is shaped so people can understand, people can't get hurt and then they don't hurt you back. One of the biggest reason, to share not full of your knowledge because we fair people would use that knowledge against us to take control over us.

After all those doing right, the moment we share something to people, we think like our words matter, when actually our perspective and delivery matters. People hardly gets your words, but they get your perpective. Simple because they connect their personal narratives to yours, the moment you deliver something that doesn't connect, they lost the continuity and can't connect the dots to fit the narrative anymore.

So let's say, you are saying something bad and delivering in some good way people like, people would still listen just because there is something new connecting their personal narratives and absorbing infos about other physical properties.

This is where acknowledgement theory comes. Acknowleg=dgement theory is when you acknolwdge something, you brain starts processing those threads unconsciously. That's like even teaching people things they don't want. So if you dont like my words but like my smile, the moment you like my smile, you acknowledge boths unless the learning technique part is really smart.

So this is what hormonal trap is. If you feel good, hormone releases and acknowldgement happens, if you feel bad, you deny and usually you don't process, if you feel weird, you remember it until the questions in reality pot is answered.

So when we get a primary learning philosophy, it's gets into our intention to make it more vivid and clear to experience it more. That's why people intentionally do things they do not usually physically need but just because of mental need to experience intentions.

An intention slowly becomes a flow with enough experienc in many mediums. Flow in human means it runs subconsciously. It's another name for habit. Another name for multiple narrative going on in ourselves. At some poin our flows becomes and it become our character. That's learning character I call. This is how acknowledgement and the whole process makes us learn. It's really lengthy and tough process.

When you ask someone to learn something that you processed for decades, they just don't have the neural connection, which is the dependency of neural connections. They can't do without the full cycle. But that's not full cycle though. At ths point they learned enough do it but they wouldn't still.

Anyway, getting off a flow is unlearning that thing. It's a lot of process and lot of connecions and threads, techniques and processes to be evaluated.
It takes a lot. But that's learnng flow we are talking. Humans have many micro and macro flows in themselves. Then our social context, human context, economics, the universe etc have many many grand and micro flows that we can't even see.

The more intelligent entity would see more flows, would be able to control learning and unlearning, getting in and out, reuse, influence others flows etc. The more control over flows the more intelligence. Basically intelligence in pattern matching in flows and changes, having control over them. Character is how a person flows in life, it's their style, it's state and we can snippet a momentum of their life to see how they flows.

Now when a person have things in their character, doesn't mean they would want to do it until their personal narratives still kicking for it. Every person is a story. The story itself the memory of the person built upon small stories, all made into bigger stories, layers of stories. Those stories and memories are the person itself, without them, the person is no more.

So learning characters are made into stories. Now they are in narratives. Stories make us move. Story has narratives, narratives makes us predict the next move of our action. For example, if you are slicing potato, next thing you will cook it and eat it. Very reasonable fit in the narrative, you wouldn't go to moon and fly. So the continuity is preicted. So what you learn next is predicted by your narratives. This narrative can have seperation for manuy people with family, people, earning, properties, jobs, leanring etc and makes us overwhelmed just because we teared apart our narrative and ran all of them simultenously.

Genuinely a person wouldn't be able to do things, all aren't same narrative build up. Possibly from early age of life.

So, if your brain asks your hand to do two things in the same time, your hand wouldn't be able to. If two hands can do two things, that's performance degradation.

A person of physics property like vibes/frequency, momentum, speed, rest etc. If your hand, brain, legs, body all are not vibing aligned, they no way you are going to perform.

The whole world is rendered to supports your vibe, if you have one purpose and the whole body aligned with it. But if your purpose and other physics properties are confused, you will not be able to get help from the world as they will be confused similar way. That's how single purpose is essential. No wonder why we do prayers practicing that motto.

## Traps

### Single State of mind

Human have single state of mind, it cant think of one thing at a time and when in one state it can't judge or think of another state.

### Negative

Then we can't think of negative, as we don't learn negativity. Too much negativity is less economical improvement, that's why we are developed by bad people who don't think negative of socially bad things

### Hormonal

Hormones, are tools to control humans. Their need and necessity, limits, cycles are determined to make us play the bigger game in the fear of we being felt out of the game.

## Care

Care is the last phase of learning. Our narrative predicts our next movement. But what if we care about our next movement or that narrative. Then it's become fully vibed, enrgized, hormonally charged. That's why care phase makes us economically active. That's why all the things in the world is to takeover this phase along with narratives. The smart people thinks we shouldn't think of hormonal care and our story that much, making is not analyze how the whole world of stupid people who have active care and story running energized body to be used fot the care set by ultra geniuses to runt he world.

# Acknowledgements Framework or decision making phase

We know Learning Cycle and Action Framework. But there is a acknowledgement framework. Acknowledgement is basically trusting something. When you trust you end the process of logic which usually used in the phases action and learning technique. Before acknowledging we actually have to go throught the evaluation phase of pattern matching. I call the acknowledgement phase as decicion making phase. Decision to act or decision to trust. Decision is made using a technique called brute forcing. Its so natural that every problem on earth is actually solved by brute forcing. Any advanced solution is basically advanced on top of brute forcing. For an intentional being, we face randomness and we have to see the probability. The probability is so tough to guess if the patterns inside can't guess any pattern, thus finds only chaos.

Now, what we do is, brute force all patterns you know to see where it fits, that's also we can also search for narrative matching. Patterns are seeked from randomness to make it a structure, so every pattern we acknowledge is a control structure.

To smplify, pattern matching is actually brute forcing. Also every pattern is seen as a flow running. Now a intentional being's intelligence is to find the pattern, control the flow of it to fit the desired solution, then we decide. Any advanced problem solver is actually constantly creating patterns in bigger picture and micro level, adjusting them, then using all their known pattern to design the learning technique pattern. This way, slowly that intelligent being usually knows what pattern works universally for all thier problems they face. Now this gives us a predictibility quality that bypasses already not so good solution. This because we work by narrative and single state of action mind. So any pattern we develop already in our narrative in a way that narrative is predicting the way for us. This any pattern we seek or project to solve a thing already in our personal narrative and the chosen problem is already known solvable by the narrative. This is crazy, miraculus and complex, yet this helps us chose and solve a problem by intuition.

So we can see intelligence is flow control, learning technique, predictibility by advanced brute forcing.

But there must be a rule to follow when chosing a problem and solution, cause in macro scale, sometimes we can't see what's the issue. For example, if you learn biology and psychology before neurology, then you are not following human perspective that are more close to human. Cause other two field are more generalized. Science does this mistake, this makes science like a raw narrativeless robot. Same way our development of civilization have same problem, it's ignoring human perspective of narrative and the needs of development there and developing things far from perspectives. This creates the problem of sociatal collapse or civilizational collapse. So the rule is always follow narrative of human and not skip the necessary concept to build that's more close to us.

This is why a learner must know the above rule to know himself before learning to not have a gap in his concept to follow the narrative of his own.

So decision/acknowldgement framework is when in the action projection framework, there is a decision making process while solving a problem, the attempts of brute forcing of pattern matching following the narrative must be acknowledged before trusting to make a decision.

Now learned intuitives. What if there are advanced things in mmodern life we need to do. also managment

## Auto Clicker

There are acknowledgements and denials in layers for each learning techniques that reshape and filter. Those techniques are set of logics. When someone talks and sclice through your techniques of filtering and reshaping, you just become numb. It rarely happens in a instant situation, if that happens, you just need to rebuild your barricades cause you are now hackable. Now a mindset or a mood basically a auto responder to a situation. A mood is a pack of direction given to act on a certain situation. The real problem is to fit the narrative and

A mood is a phase where intention lives. A mood is set to perform the Learning Intention.

But normally some ideas clicks in so many logic that we eventually sets that a goal to achieve. It's a volunteer act and there is a mood required. It's learning mood or a gaming mood.

To do something or learn something better, the mood is a sign of commitment.

In the modern world we are privileged to have those mood, not just serious mood. Gives us a chance to do a thing for long term. Eventually don't let us do a lot of actions we could do to help others, we decide to take help and use that time to work on something. We call it a project. To solve this problem going out of the bound of survival and societal collapse, we must set our projects inside our care framework.

So when a primary philosophy is gained, what if the pride of the learner motivates him to decide that it is gonna be something they wanna do? A commitment phase occurs. Commitment is another volunteer act for intentional being. It makesus do things and it's a kind of do mood after a decision is made and care scale refers to do it.

So a project is a volunteer act, it doesn't come from goals, it is the goal, it comes from ideas. Only if you care, project starts. So care > project.

Everything we do is from a perspective. A perspective that comes from our narratives, flows and all. So every idea delivered is actually from a perspective.

Every story is from a perspective, so every story is a perspective in terms. Flow control is controlling. Perspectives are the tiny tiny range of learning techniques that allow to take one information far accurately, express an information far accurately. Perspectives are harmony, melodious, cinematic.

So let me list all the frameworks needed -

1. Learning evolution - primary philosophy, secondary philosoophy, advanced taxonomy
