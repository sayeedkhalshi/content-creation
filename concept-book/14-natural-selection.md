Evolution happens by the process of natural selection. Natural selection is when a part of nature is useless and when changes in a material happens so fast for natural reason like movement - for example by air, moving organisms, pressure, energy, vibration. Because of them they change so fast and eventually micro difference in each change becomes a big change faster. Only things that doesn’t change faster stays stable for long time. This change is natural selection as we call it nature selects the best one. It’s not selecting best one. There may not be a big brain out there like our neural network brain.
