Learning is like the universe - in deep down it’s atom connecting each other, like neurons connecting each other. Then creating a element, like neuron can create multineuron bigger structure. Those elements are making rockets to worm. Our brain can create many things out of it. The neurons are using same way the nature is creating us. Cause a brain holds a lot of ability of the nature. It can create the whole house in your brain’s neuron. Similarly our computers. All three of them are real cause they happens in the same nature. If one is not real then other is not real too. Your thoughts are real. Made by elements of the world. That’s why brain can project things.
