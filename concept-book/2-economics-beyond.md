# The Economins Beyond

You see, in old age, people try harder just to control hormonally influenced acts that affect their lives. But at a young age, one thing that helps us learning is creating habits through training our hormonal actions and using the desire to be in a flow of intelligence. It’s a balancing act.

You thought economics is based on people's emotions. You thought people have emotions, happiness, and anxiety. You didn’t think it’s also a balancing act. Balancing act means it has a cycle. A cycle means it has phases. Phases has levels, directions, continuity, start, end and progress.

Intentional beings like humans think towards achieving singularity, this uses a linear style to go forward. Then, the desire to have a better perspective make us something somehow keep coming back to our old learnings, like a cycle. Nature gives a cycle so nature can heal, and an intentional being (human) can learn from facing it again and again.

Changes in society, of course, are driven by what anyone feels. A happy person makes dumb decisions, fails, becomes anxious, tries harder, learns, succeeds, gets tired of anxiousness, and then tries to be happy again without that success. A happy group neglects a sad group; the sad group becomes tough. When the tough group is tired of sadness, they become happy, and at that point they have to accept their fate. I call this force acknowledgement. But at one phase, they regain toughness. When the happy group becomes dumb, they take over. I call this a cycle of balance. It doesn’t matter how small that group is. Cause human capability isn’t bound by size. It’s intelligence, which is learning ability, and it's heavily governed by anxiety.

You probably never thought PTSD and Post Traumatic Growth could have such a profound impact. Nice. Now you can tell this is how institutional and civilizational growth happens.

But growth and changes can be stable too. For example, once we and foxes all were hunting in the wild and have our fair share. Now we have taken over the production of chicken. Foxes has no way but steal from our resources. Now we think foxes are bad cause they steal. It’s a stable change for next few thousands or millions of years.

You probably have seen how intelligence is the defining factor in taking over or have control. But you can’t even imagine how intelligence is playing it’s part to have that influence.
Intelligence lives in the human context, which is actually social context. Economics is like the physics of social context. But economics is based on action based on emotions. Remember Economics has cycle and cycle has phases. This is a balancing act.

But can you imagine what does an intelligence do to take over someone? By building a control structure so hard that it is stable. But also by taking over economic flows. Flow is a vast and profound word that is played only by intentional beings. But also by learning and teaching those flows to followers and making use of them while they are in your recommended flow.

Flow has rhytm. Flow is created by waves of rythms. Flow keeps going, and we function in flows. Recommended flow is something you are doing, but recommended by some others. Those others can predict your actions and emotions even for years, cause usually they have gone through or seen through. The rule is to make people fall into a flow and make use of them. A socially accepted norm.

Flow has some rules - it keeps going, going out of it is hard. Getting into it has a narrow path. An easy way is the hormonal trap, but the recommended flow and feel good theory is very tough to acknowledge for people with OCD or ADHD.

Which is why everyone in old age may face the burden of hormonally affected flow like a OCD.

For some group or generation of people who has acknowledged some flow by force in between the act of keeping balance by cycles and phases, are having a very harsh life. If the rule is to make people fall into a flow, and make use of them, submission is the only way to survive the outcome of OCD.

If this is true, vast majority of women are submissive may be because this to bypass the numbness of harsh pain that evolution couldn’t ignore. Cause you can tell evolution keeps using negative emotions to develop us, yet some of the negative emotions are taken in consideration like this.

The point is, that doesn't mean women has giveup their power of control, they took another path. Why I say balance is so important, because it's too obvious without the balance. Things can be seen from far. But if there is balance, from far, nothing can be seen. That's the perfect definition of chaos.

Would you give up your control over the foxes? Or even to the cows? That would be true chaos.

The fundamental of economics is trading control. On the surface, it may look like, we are trading goods and money, but actually the game beyond that, is trading control. It is between humans, among animals or even beyond that if you can think about spiritual world etc.

A simple way to understand this would be identifying all the influences over us. But it's tricky to identify all of them. There are hidden things like, hidden character flows and perspectives that are running us. There are spiritual entities that we can't see but have huge influence on us. There is God, alien, conspiracies or anything we know, don't know has influence over us.

My acknowledgement theory says, you can't build a problem free structure, if that structure don't acknowledge everything it has power over.

The logic is, trading control is the biggest game there is.
