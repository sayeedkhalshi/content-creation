## Economics Beyond

A control structure is a structure made to control something.

Who controls us?

Once we and foxes would live in the wild and both would get our share of wild and foods.

Now we took over the resources of producing chickens and wild. The foxes has no way but to steal from us to survive.

Now, would you trade the control over chicken production to foxes from us?

What is economics?

Economics is people producing things, making things, and trading them with people for other things or money like universal exchanging tool. Everyone fullfilling their need by selling and buying. So, it's like the distribution of wealth between all the people, right? So, economics is like the process of distributing wealth to the people who want the money and who is working for the money.

Let me make it clear to you again. It's about people who want the money, who need the money. Because of the want and need, they work. And because of their work, they create the services or products.

At some point, people thought that they could just pile up the money, because this is the place where power lives. And that's why they started piling up money by creating the product that massively needed and stopping other people to produce it. And that's how it started for the rich.

Since it's a free society, to stay rich, the need of economics is to, for the rich, it is needed to make other people not to produce the product that are massively needed, just they want to control the production of the product and distribution of the product, so they stay rich, thus this is where it becomes about control and trading control, that's why I say, trading control.

Normally economics normally would re-distribute wealth accross every individual, if it's not controlled and maintained. This is why all kind of economic structure emerged out of manipulation.

What this also says, piling up money to become rich is purely aritificial rich, if the production isn't controlled. Cause money isn't the real need, it's the artificial need, actual need is the product. The need for every human is limited and production of resources are also limited by each one. Normally this would be a harmony. But when you are piling money, the demand of money must be kept by controlling the production, this money becomes a need too. This also can be done easily with recommending artificial needs that's out of ordinary, made the rich create economical structure to persist the management of those recommended artificial needs(recommended flows). Thus the idea of economical institution came on the sight.

It could self fullling exchange for all of us.

Then the modern developments for other needs, where knowledge is needed to be controlled to decrease the spread of modern production of special resources, for example medicine. So the knowledge resources are controlled.

Then knowledge could be acquired, so the ability of acquiring knowledge must be controlled too. This is how scientific fields like psychology started making the driver of learning 'anxiety' a disease.

But still some people would learn and we need to drive them below care phase, where economics stays. This is why sociology or socially discussabilty of a topic in ruined and having charisma is oppressive aggression in modern world. This is how nerds get into sciences and social knowledge are not connectible to the narrative of sciences.

After that not many people exists to run a control structure provider. Then there still would be people passing all above hardles. This much people can be allowed or they could be to be controlled by direct wars.

Those are the things to say are economics. What if those still gives a huge limitation of concept about economics. Those are what we know, but what if there is more?

According to my acknowledgement theory, if you don't acknowledge all the parties influencing a control structure and according to my flow theory, if you don't consider all the recommended flows created by those influencers in our human context, we will always have problems in our life. According to cyclic nature, we would always reach the peak and fall and start over.

## Trading Control

A control structure has providers or enforcers and users or elements in it. Providers are designer, enforcers are the maintainers, users are the community, elements are the recommended flows in that structure. By the pyramid theory, every control structure is a pyramid structure, where people on top always gets most benefit. So the game of controlling is pretty vivid there. Also every control structure follows community theory.

In a control structure, every action has a outcome, and every interaction is trading control.

By everything theory, we all are basically trading control in each and every interaction.

So coming to the point, in a control structure, each and everything has influences over the users. Even if they are non existent or invisible or spiritual. The reason is anxiety that makes everything real and you can't escape.

(But let's not just dictate things, I have frameworks of how they work with each other fundamentally.)

Anyway, Would God give up his power to human? Will humans give away the power to the foxes? Alongside God, how many things can you think of that influences a control structure, thus our economics?

## How Mathematics a No Brainer

Arithmetic and Mathematics aren't invented in a vacuum. They are invented because we needed to manage things. This is how deep is our necessity of management. Because we just don't do things out of vacuum. Because it's our personal narrative suggest us to do the next thing. The moment we fail to manage the variables of our daily life, we fail to calculate our understanding of pasts and can't prove the positivity of executing the next move.

About math, in the beginning, It was the innovation of division. We could do addition, but multiplication algorithms gave us mass addition capability. Instantly we could reverse back to see how many times. Subtractions would give us back what quotient and divider are. But those calculations would stop at the point where the numbers couldn't be divided anymore. Sometimes they couldn't be divided using any numbers we know. Those are primes and when you divide with any, they gave us remainders.

It's the remainders and primes gave us most of modern mathematical structures. In cryptography, the purpose of operations on structures are to only translate and preserve the same structure in order to prove a positive prediction that allow us to execute our next move. Basically survival of the structure even after operations on it. Yes, it's not just philosophy of proof you need to understand to be a mathematician. It's the philosophy management and the philosophy of positive predictability too will turn you into a real inventor indeed.

I am reimagining what once someone said in college, when you think of sets, it's the divine thing, it's the first thing we structured, only fundamental rule exists in the universe to make a structure.

A structure in mathematics that have some rules. The only rule of set is some elements together. That's all and you can't find a second rule on that fundamental level or deeper, you could create a new type of math today. There is one rule and one structure. But we thought okay, since there isn't any other rule in the universe fundamentally, then think of sets as the fundamental and give it many more rules inside that spectrum. That's one of a way to explain how we created groups, rings, fields, lattices etc. We did them out of necessity, out of management, rules grew on us.

Let's go deeper, what can you think of as a secret? This is also a singularity like set. It's only some data belongs in a set. You can only have some data, some letters or numbers or even combinations as a set. Is there can be things that's not data? Data is replicable, thus any secret can be guessed. If you find something non-replicable, you would create a new world order in the department of secrecy today.

Talking about operations, suppose you have a set of elements and want to combine them in some way like adding numbers, composing rotations, or concatenating strings.

That "combining" is not arbitrary, it comes from our need to manage interactions between elements.

Conceptually, we're saying, If these things exist together, how do I move from one to another in a controlled, predictable way? Meaning, it's another structure made with a desire to be a controlled outcome.

Because predictable positivity only happens in a 'control structure'. But all of the above screams one thing - manageability. Control made into a structure from just a few operations of those main 4 (+, -, x, /) and nothing else.

A 'group' also has four rules on top of the divine set rule. Groups are conceptual management structures. A group is essentially a framework to manage how elements interact under an operation, with maximum predictability and minimal chaos (Chaos is a negative predictability that makes us unsure to command and execute).

The rules are forced by the requirement for consistency, not arbitrarily imposed.

## The game of deception

Where game theory comes from? The big picture that shows where it lives, how and why it's there in human context.

A mathematical structure, for example the basic one - "set", we only have operations between elements, which are equivalent to interactions, we can predict the changes after using math. But what if they are not just mere dead elements, but a real intentional being who need resources and has scarcity set by some limits. You give them some more properties that implicates control over each other, they can annihilate each other by having power over each other, you give some hormonal control to set natural limit, also capability to rest and recycle over their actions, now to survive they have to play the game of negotiation based on their power and weakness. But still that doesn't work for game theory. Game theory comes in only when they start lying and deception. If you don't know every interactions in a intentional beings context is a manipulation in the lowest to highest level, I call this a full metal control structure.

Control structure is any structure made to control the outcome. basically control theory but in an intentional being's (human) context. Now I say, the implications of control structure is deception.

Control structure is because of anxiety of survival, which implicates the positive predictibility of resources, which is scarcity management. And management of scarcity gives us the game where we keep building and keep building.

Also this feels like a game because the deception is only way to survive in a control structure. This is why interactions in social context are manipulations. If we look at my flow theory (not the one in psychology), the way of deception is making people fall in a flow and make use of that.

Basically deception is making people acknowledge a flow and deceive them in the process, because if you run in a recommended flow, the provider of the recommended flow can predict your actions.

Now my interaction theory says, we have multiple manipulative reformation of our ideas before we speak it put socially. Game of decision making is here because of all this recommended flows coming in to you, deceiving you to acknowledge, must be gone through positive and negative prdictibility evaluation, reshaping and filterting in the leaning technique phase in the learning cycle.

Now if you can have a uncontrolled structure, the deception might go away and that's probably the case of our souls in the heavens. In real world, I am yet to see a uncontrolled structure.

In action - projection framework, this goes in action part. What we do is try to be a hero, so people can believe what we are creating a uncontrolled structure, we are fond to believe, nice guys are creating uncontrolled structure. So heroes are front face of recommending flows.

Also control structure automatically builds the pyramid model, where the provider of the structure are usually on top.

Now, because all structure made by a intentional being are control structure, there is deception by default, where decision is critical, game theory applies, if the people know your game, they can rebel and take over as a provider.

We know If it's a uncontrolled structure, it could be trusted, but there is no uncontrol structure.

So we should try making a structure that acknowledges the rules of a control structure with authenticity. The properties of a control structure are recommended flows, hidden flows, providers, enforcers, users.

The closest thing to a uncontrolled structure is a group of people where you need to pretend to be uncontrolling. I am not sure, but it could be mothers, it could be love.

## The flow we struggle to control

You see, in old age, people try harder just to control hormonally influenced acts that affect their lives. But at a young age, one thing that helps us learning is creating habits through training our hormonal actions and using the desire to be in a flow of intelligence. It’s a balancing act.

You thought economics is based on people's emotions. You thought people have emotions, happiness, and anxiety. You didn’t think it’s also a balancing act. Balancing act means it has a cycle. A cycle means it has phases. Phases has levels, directions, continuity, start, end and progress.

Intentional beings like humans think towards achieving singularity, ignoring it has limtis and it's a cycle, use a linear style mental model to go forward. Then, the desire to have a better perspective make us something somehow keep coming back to our old learnings, like a cycle. Nature gives a cycle so nature can heal, and an intentional being (human) can learn from facing it again and again.

Changes in society, of course, are driven by what anyone feels. A happy person makes dumb decisions, fails, becomes anxious, tries harder, learns, succeeds, gets tired of anxiousness, and then tries to be happy again without that success. A happy group neglects a sad group; the sad group becomes tough. When the tough group is tired of sadness, they become happy, and at that point they have to accept their fate. I call this force acknowledgement. But at one phase, they regain toughness. When the happy group becomes dumb, they take over. I call this a cycle of balance. It doesn’t matter how small that group is. Cause human capability isn’t bound by size. It’s intelligence, which is learning ability, and it's heavily governed by anxiety.

Looking at above passage, you probably never thought PTSD and Post Traumatic Growth could have such a profound impact on civilizations. Nice. Now you can tell this is how institutional and civilizational growth happens.

But growth and changes can be stable too. For example, once we and foxes all were hunting in the wild and have our fair share. Now we have taken over the production of chicken. Foxes has no way but steal from our resources. Now we think foxes are bad cause they steal. It’s a stable change for next few thousands or millions of years.

You probably have seen how intelligence is the defining factor in taking over or have control. But you can’t even imagine how intelligence is playing it’s part to have that influence.

Intelligence lives in the human context, which is actually social context. Economics is like the physics of social context. But economics is based on action based on emotions. Remember Economics has cycle and cycle has phases. This is a balancing act.

But can you imagine what does an intelligence do to take over someone? By building a control structure so hard that it is stable. Also by taking over economic flows. Flow is a vast and profound word that is played only by intentional beings. But also by learning and teaching those flows to followers and making use of them while they are in your recommended flow.

Flow has rhytm. Flow is created by waves of rythms. Flow keeps going, and we function in flows. Recommended flow is something you are doing, but recommended by some others. Those others can predict your actions and emotions even for years, cause usually they have gone through or seen through those flows or insitutionally mass experimented. The rule is to make people fall into a flow and make use of them. A socially accepted norm.

Flow has some rules - it keeps going, going out of it is hard. Getting into it has a narrow path, cause it's target, probably has it's own frquency we need to synchronize. An easy way to make people synchronize with your flow is the hormonal trap by feel theory, but the recommended flow and feel good theory is very tough to acknowledge for people with OCD or ADHD, which is little control over what flow to get on and get off.

Which is why everyone in old age may face the burden of hormonally affected flow like a OCD.

For some group or generation of people who has acknowledged some flow by force in between the act of keeping balance by cycles and phases, are having a very harsh life. If the rule is to make people fall into a flow, and make use of them, submission is the only way to survive the outcome of OCD. Get used to it and micro manage it to fix what you don't like, but still humans are dangerously weak in this place. Recommended flow providers are the hunters, you can't escape.

If this is true, vast majority of women are submissive may be because this to bypass the numbness of harsh pain that evolution couldn’t ignore. Cause you can tell evolution keeps using negative emotions to develop us, yet some of the negative emotions are taken in consideration like this.

The point is, that doesn't mean women has giveup their power of control, they took another path. Why I say balance is so important, because it's too obvious without the balance. Things can be seen from far. But if there is balance, from far, nothing can be seen. That's the perfect definition of chaos.

Anyway, would you give up your control over the foxes? Or even to the cows? That would be true chaos.

The fundamental of economics is trading control. On the surface, it may look like, we are trading goods and money, but actually the game beyond that, is trading control. It is between humans, among animals or even beyond that if you can think about spiritual world etc.

A simple way to understand this would be identifying all the influences over us. But it's tricky to identify all of them. There are hidden things like, hidden character flows and perspectives that are running us. There are spiritual entities that we can't see but have huge influence on us. There is God, alien, conspiracies or anything we know, don't know has influence over us.

My acknowledgement theory says, you can't build a problem free structure, if that structure don't acknowledge everything it is influenced by.

We may not save the whole thing. But in trading control, what see still need to managed better or possibly perfect with a voluntery uncontrolled structure or a group.

The logic is, trading control is the biggest game there is. Then you need to acknowledge, each and every influence on this.

A mathematical structure works for dead objects. For an intentional being, mathematical outcomes are manipulated and neglegable in a control structure. But still the fundamental of set persists, you need to be together to have a control structure.

## The community theory

A control structure has a community and community has interactions.
