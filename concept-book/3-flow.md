# Flow

If everything in this universe is moving, everything has a flow. Flow attracts others close to it. That's one property. Flow has many properties. But for human character, the concept of Learning Flow, which I also call just flow out of my intrusive thoughts, is something that makes a learning running without consciously ordering it to happen in need. It means that flow has passed the criteria to be a flow to be trusted to work perfectly autonomously without new adjustment while doing it. This is why it's not easy to create a flow in your character.

The reason I call it flow because everything in our brain is like a flow, anything in it keeps going on, like towards one or many direction. That's why I say flows are directional. But In our brain also each flow staying has a meaning attached to it. It's not just something, it has a meaning, and we remember it using that meaning. That meaning is the story of it, so everything also a story and every story has a narrative. This is how narrative theory comes in. Though fundamentally, every neuron or neuron groups has a purpose, which means a flow, with a story and a narrative and other properties also.

Every flow has a frequency. If you synchronize with that frequency, we get into that flow. So, spiritually anyone trying get into divine world by matching the divine flow. (If we do that in a computer brain that is done by frequency as a data mapping point to connect logic, that would be a main flow or consciousness)
