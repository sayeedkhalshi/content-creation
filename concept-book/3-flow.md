# Flow

## Adaptibility

Every flow has a frequency. If you synchronize with that frequency, we get into that flow. So, spiritually anyone one try get into divine world y matching the divine flow. If we do that, a computer brain that is done by frequency as a data mapping point to connect logic, that would be a main flow or consciousness

Cycles are sometimes interrupted to make it own. Some cycles are natural and some cycles are made by us. Which are artificial cycles, that has to go through each phase, what I call learning pots to fill.

Adaptibility is when you can end a cycle at any time. But this doesn't happen smoothly. Specially when we know if we don't go full cycle we will miss a lot of learning and we won't go full experience. Now that we haven't learned ut fully, it illogical to end a cycle.

One of the biggest property of intelligence is controlling flow by creating, ending, completing or ending without completing, redirecting etc.
