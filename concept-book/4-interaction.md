# Interaction of the objects

Interaction creates new things, changes old things. Interaction is the fundamental rule for operations in the structure of this universe.
For the objects that are unintentional, changes appears to us as survival anxieties.

# Interaction for humans

When we talk, we use the frontal lobe. So that's the interaction part of the brain, right? But it does the interaction. Some people say that it's the destiny. Like the forehead is the destiny. Some people think like that, right? Actually, it's because this is the part that talks for us. This is actually feels like self. Because it's doing all the seeing, looking, interacting. It's the main decision-making part. So this part is doing all those things. Actually, that part is us, right? Brain way. And spiritual way, the main part is the heart, near the heart, right? So this is the connection between the God. But sometimes people think like that. It's too fine, right?

So the heart is the connection to the God. That's why the wise peoples have problem with their frontal lobe. The more they are tortured, their frontal lobe gets bad and they get better connection with God and they gain knowledge. Is that the way? I don't know.

Main point is that when a brain talks in a substitution, it gives and takes two kind of flow. Flow means frequency, right? Follow around in a frequency. Now, if another person who is interrupting, they will receive and share those frequencies. So, each time a brain will send on frequency. So, one is about one on frequency each time, not multiple, because of single state of action mind. But, lot of frequency using, one after one, can work for the brain when it interrupts.

So, depending on the interaction, the people who is accepting the interaction is having problem. I mean, he is accepting two kinds of frequency. One is wording and the other is perspective. And perspective and wording, two kinds of frequency are accepted and the person who is interacting also has to agree and deny the wording. So, one is they are talking in the same frequency or they are talking in a different frequency if they are disagreeing.

Depending on the person who is agreeing and another who is denying. Agreeing is in the same frequency, but their wording and perspective may differ. Because if they are talking in the same frequency of wording, they are pretending. But if they are both talking in the same frequency of perspective, they are agreeing. And if they are denying, then they will talk and wording in different frequency. Now this is how we interact with each other.

Human interaction models have a really, really big issue, a big connection with control structure. Control structure is such a thing that totally influences our interaction, so which way and how we talk. Every time we're talking, it's a flow we're describing, but we're stopping the flow interacting. Defined like mind flow, wording flow, perspective flow, many kind of things, and high flow, many kind of flow we can.

In interaction, single state of action mind creates a lot of manipulative things. Then creating flows with hormonal reward to make them forget the previous thing as human action mind only can see one at a time, if the flow doesn't go away, its strongly flowing

The positive predictiblity is the thing we always to do in a interaction. But we will deep dive in all later.

Economics structure
Care scale results commitment
The base of economics purposeful interaction
The base of purposeful interaction is economic gain.
Gain is inside a structure
Structure has to be made and community has to be grown
The base of economics structure is community
The base of community is to assist each other to help their gain
The base of economical commitment is the availability
Two type of structure and gain\
Gamified or psychological - availability is the parameter to be used as measuring unit in human context based on the rule of ‘single state of action mind - says only thing we know that's happening in the mind and we don’t know what’s not happening now. Gaming(Hide and seek) on that can take us to higher leverage, the game is actually the main negotiation of how much control you wanna give away and how much you can take over
Here comes my flow theory - that you can make people acknowledge (trust) some of your flow. Which is another law that means feeling your ‘recommended flow’ as good. Where ‘good’ comes from another law of believing of it purposeless (no economical gain, which comes from the law of spirituality where we help each other purposelessly, but spirituality also says we must hold our purpose, so the game allowed by even spiritually. The greatness comes from the combination of both, cunningness and bad karma comes from unhealthy cunningness as the simulation(kayanat) wouldn’t support and you will be on your own ). The game is to make people fall in a flow that you want them to be in and use it for purpose til its sounds healthy. This is how you build a structure that is always trying to be controlled. A community is a control structure. You care about the people who come in the purpose to help you and get help for their own economic gain. This is why experience people plays better because they know what happens when you join that particular new flow (part of the community) and know how to drive people on command. As time passes new ones get experience and hates the provider of the control structure. This hate comes from the same law of flow, because flow some properties, some of them are it’s hard to get on and it’s hard to get off. Some deeply acknowledged flow are hard to get on and we feel embarrassed of acknowledging that wrong flow or proud of the right flow. Usually this becomes really complex in society
Physical - physical gain in assets (not important now)
