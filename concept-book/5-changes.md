# Changes, RandomNess, Probability, Intentional Being, Predictibiity

## Probability --> Single State of action mind, comparison, weakness brain

Changing in the universe starts from little quarks and their basic properties like frequency, vibration, size, charge, interactibility creates random things. Those things are changes. Those changes are learning of the universe. It is natural selection. The things changes slowly stays. That doesn’t mean natural selection selects. There is noone to select. It’s randomly created things and among them some changes slowly. It’s similar learning pattern. Things connects to things to create more things. Our brain, philosophy, computer, perspective, context, evolution, learning, changes, ai etc are easy to notice learning system. But you can easily see everywhere everything are in little or large learning system. So to make a perfect learning for our brain, there is no way but natural way. Evolution is nature’s learning. Where every system may have different characteristics. For this reason everything can generate can new things. There is always perspective to explain things that sounds have no connection. Everything can be connected somehow.
