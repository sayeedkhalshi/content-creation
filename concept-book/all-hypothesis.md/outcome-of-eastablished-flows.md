That the world is designed with flows, recommended flows and basically you are not the first to do a thing, most case scenerio, the thing has been done by others, so the thing you learned already learned by others or what you learn and do already because the the whole world system recommended you in very micro or macro ways. So basically every outcome is already projected and thus already has been hacked or predicted. So the action could be predicted very precisely for every human being if someone could know all the flows in our context. Flows can predict future accurately.
