Where game theory comes from? The big picture that shows where it lives, how and why it's there in human context.

A mathematical structure, for example the basic one - "set", we only have operations between elements, which are equivalent to interactions, we can predict the changes after using math. But what if they are not just mere dead elements, but a real intentional being who need resources and has scarcity set by some limits. You give them some more properties that implicates control over each other, they can annihilate each other by having power over each other, you give some hormonal control to set natural, limit, rest and recycling of of their actions, now to survive they have to play the game of negotiation based on their power and weakness. But still that doesn't work for game theory. Game theory comes in only when they start lying and deception. If you don't know every interactions in a intentional beings context is a manipulation in the lowest level. I call this a full control structure.

Control structure is any structure made to control the outcome. basically control theory but in an intentional being's (human) context. Now I say, the implications of control structure is deception.

Control structure is because of anxiety of survival, which implicates the positive predictibility of resources, which is scarcity management.

Now this feels like a game because the deception is only way to survive in a control structure. This is why interactions in social context are manipulations. If we look at my flow theory (not the one in psychology), the way of deception is making people fall in a flow and make use of that.

Basically deception is making people acknowledge a flow and deceive them in the process, because if you run in a recommended flow, the provider of the recommended flow can predict your actions.

Now my interaction theory says, we have multiple manipulative reformation of our ideas before we put it on social. Game of decision making is here because of all this recommended flows coming in to you, must be gone through positive and negative prdictibility evaluation, reshaping and filterting in the leaning technique phase in the learning cycle.

Now if you can have a uncontrolled structure, the deception might go away and that's probably the case of our souls in the heavens. In real world, I am yet to see a uncontrolled structure.

In action - projection framework, this goes in action part.

Also control structure automatically builds the pyamid model, where the provider of the structure are usually on top.

Now, because all structure made by a intentional being are control structure, there is deception by default, where decision is critical, game theory applies. But if the

If it's a uncontrolled structure, it could be trusted, but there is no uncontrol structure.

So we should try to make a structure that acknowledges the rules of a control structure with authenticity. The properties of a control structure are recommended flows, hidden flows, providers, enforcers, users.

The closest thing to a uncontrolled structure is a group of people whe you need to pretend to be uncontrolling
