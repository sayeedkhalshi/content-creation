This more like spirituality.

Test happens only towards reaching the desire you care about. This is like a chain, you show care only when you say it loud, in full niyat. Can't believe we have been disregarding the importance of niyah for so long.

Desire is the flow, you run when you care in long term. Purpose is more intentional, but purpose is full body and full vibe expression, but intention is more alive in brain only, hasn't been full body purpose yet. But also combination of all exists, and that can give anyone superpower.

Test happens for the thing, if you care.

So basically, thinking with care brings hormonal flows, but on long term it brings autonomous actions, rewires brain. Makes our focus narrow. Make us understand less. It should be necessary for actions only when needed, not for long term holding a care for anything.

Feels like God testing you for what you care, by not giving it to you, but eventually, you are lacking the insights and experience from other things required and you are too narrow to see it.

All of those reasons, make a intelligent person not care about what he thinks, train themselves to see things more clearly. Meditation is one of the tools.

Positivity and negativity both.

Now spiritually you can say both are true. I mean it's heavenly to test your creative courage to reach your goal you care about. That's why prophets are tested for their belief's in Allah, you are not because you haven't cared about Allah yet and your life caring about things that's not Allah and so your test is in somewhere else.

But then also, the more hardness you had to go through to reach it, the more strength and perspectives open up for you, that's like another law.

In practical, care stays as a thread in your brain, a hidden flow that you could discover too.

In learning cycle, care is where economics lives, action lives. That's why spiritual magic and miracles happens in this space. Religions, Gods all have their special influence in this phase only.
