2. There are let's say point/steps when you talk. Listeners has to keep each point in his brain step by step. Thhen for each steps, we also create and attach a answer to those steps, like the pointer element (word) that we say to remember that thing. Like as a reference. Step by step how many times can you keep those points. Both of those steps and answers, (everything goes like a question, like what is, is it gonna break my narratives, is it unfit to go in, if yes then goes in with an answer) Not much, If someoone listening, and you can have more points than usual, most people will forget the logic and say yes. It's even true for keeping up with your lifes event too. There is only so much we can remember. If so many times you are taught a wrong value for a thing, even if you know it's wrong, after the steps of that many, you will only know the logic of recent and say good about it.
3. Acknowlegdement with making people like one thing and but attched with wrong context that people wouldn't like but silencely make a acknowlegdement and people start learning by unconscious threads.
4. People listen to persective delivery, not the words. But starts processing words as it is attached with it.
