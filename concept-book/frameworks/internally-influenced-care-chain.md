The care chain of internally influenced learning
The care phase:- Story - made of memory made of philosophy made of neural connections, Life - made of the story, Narrative - made of the story(narrative is stronger, powerful than life, and not controllable), Care - made of narratives, stories, philosophies made of thoughts we care. Here, ptedictoon creates projection; we care about projection and do action on it. Action depends on the scale of caring that projection to make it completion.
Care gives purpose, and purpose blends in and creates vibes
Vibes create directions for each movement
Purposelessness makes us chaotic movement
Strong mind / weak mind phase - can you focus on what you say and believe on it so good that nothing negative comes to mind. We need to think many way, but not anxiety way and strong mind can stay for positive and focused. Here also works motivation etc. But a neglectful path leads to not learning it. But when you acknowledge, sometimes the path is too much to journey, evolve and learn
Interaction phase
This phase creates interactions
You can break a lot of story of people by saying something against that story where people gives too much passion energy and devotion. Ex - music and you say something against a musician. Or any group
In this journey - we need a lot of time, 30-40 years to learn about us and we can’t focus on others and after that we start learning others. Which is a phase after your are social. A lot of huge flows running us like that. Those are in broader spectrum for a person to see and control. Those flows indicates a lot of threads running in our character not decided by us but biological or god. We believe if we can go out of the box, at some point we may see what are the flows we are in in bigger spectrum for karmic flow and god’s plan flow (just stating, we are not merely a weak brain, but we may see some)
The stage where we learn to activate parts of brain is to focus and analyze one thing. Very early of being a learner, you need to start seeing things i things that not there but comes from analysis. Now that will be your primary goal of life, your purpose you will feel. WHich means you can see this purpose of life flow here.
Flow-
Flow is actually developed from our pattern-seeking nature. Pattern is found means we need to set it as an gained one that can be used. To do that we use pleasure hormone to make it careable and lovable. When that’s not enough, we make it prideable. So saving a pattern is to seek more patterns. Seeking and establishing and giving in to your pattern is our nature so our next learning can happen.
Purposefulness framework
Based on perception changes as perspective is narrowed down to support purposefullness
Reality may be shifted by the simulation to support your purposefulness.
Neuroscience suggests only focus changes brain
New babys are borned more purposeful
Purposefullness changes your body language and gives you vibes that gives society to get hints on how to act with you and you your way if your vibes suggests your purposefullness
Vibe is the expression of your story and purposefulness helps the continuity of your story
Religions like Islam supports purposefullness and emphasis on ‘Niyah’ or true intention.
Meditation is about one single thought focus. But focus just doesn’t come, focus comes with purposefulness.
Purposefulness can be complex and micro level adjustment is required in social interaction
The example is 3 idiots and how rancho solves problem

Conscious phase - Intentions - made of philosophies, narratives made of care. But intentions can’t dictate actions powerfully or smoothly. It’s the flow that does the work smoothly
Conscious phase has vibes and

Subconscious phase:- Flow — made of intentions, flows dictate our actions

Decision phase - made by flows, intentions are like threads trying to influence flows, making a flow is making a learning to go in a character and decisions are actually close to acknowledgments, but not actually acknowledgments. Intention is the phase where we shape information/neural connections to meet our intentions

Character phase - a character is full of flows

Perspective phase - The whole character gives a man perspectives. Perspectives are made of all the flows of their own philosophical decision. There is a reason, we can’t do things we decide to do or we intend to do, because they are not the flow, they are not built into a character or not built into a perspective

Perspective phase - Made of decisions, creates flows,
Intention phase - perspective creates intentions. Intentions are yet to be made into flow. In conventional sense, intention is the learning phase. Cause we only see that part. This is where force learning happens.
Because this part shapes learning, creates learning techniques and styles, this part gets heavily influenced by others.
Because this part creates flow, we try to create flow in others by making their intentions to what we want. The technique is making people show what is good, validate them be good having that flow. Then use that flow against their will.
Traps - this is where all the traps, fallacies, biases all exist. Psychology only talks about this. That’s why I say psychology misses a huge context.

Shaping phase - Intentions shapes our learning, and Intentions create learning techniques. Techniques that we use to shape. It’s the part we create patterns. Patterns to learn a topic and patterns to how to learn. This two technique keeps evolving. This two technique creates learning style of a person. In this phase we validate learning towards our intentions, questions, doubts and finally create a technique we pass to rewire our brain.

Validation phase -answers doubt, and validates so it can form/shape our learning, 6,7 are known as learning in conventional sense.

Acknowledgement/unacknowledgement phase - Acknowledges those forma, shaped learning. Only acknowledged learning goes to rewire the brain. Unacknowledged learnings are divalidated and we put in to further process or discard to the back of our mind

Unconscious process phase, learning process, wiring, rewiring - this is where acknowledged learnings are processed and it’s not consciously understandable and takes huge time and energy. If you don’t be smart enough to acknowledge this heavy loading, all your learning will be under processed and you will always be confused with heavy head.
Neural connection phase - Neural connections are created to do some action. They have a purpose. Each purpose has its own flow. Each flow is pointed toward a certain flow to support a much bigger/imortant flow. Like a magnet or like electrical wiring. Rewiring to other flows is a physical thing and we have to wait until it finishes.
Learning philosophy phase - wiring creates a new philosophy like a magic that you can talk about.
Narrative phase - philosophies are formed in the narrative. Its really impossible and psychologically intolerable to generate a philosophy that doesn’t fit the narrative of a person. Narrative is technical thing to brain, not speakable. Narrative can be seen in the character of a person. But story build from narratives are speakable. It refines the new philosophy to
Story phase - this narrative makes into the story - now this is where all the reality pots, and other pots that in all the context of the brain has to fit in to make this new philosophy. Story is the highest social a human person can get. Story is a social thing. Story is life. Every person has their own story building from the beginning. Story stays in memory. If story is gone, the person is gone. Narrative might be there. But story is the person itself.
Care phase - Here the story or life make a person to care. Care to do things for itself. This care phase is larger than life. Care phase totally runs on the flows of a character. This is where a person lives the life happily. Its the surface of our mind. It’s thin and you an sink in the below ocean of other parts easily. Care is a state of mind and phase of mind both. All the disorders are measured from here considering it a scale. Considering understandbility of all the phases not just this one us great skillset. Once you terms engineer all the stage. You get better understanding of human context. We can have maths of human context

The full chain of externally influenced learning
Learning pride, When we are in the care Phase- our newly build philosophies are there to be shared. That’s our Pride that I figured something out.
Pride becomes ground. That learning becomes a ground to grow on. But when you talk to someone and attack that ground, people can’t function without that ground as it’s the existence. So gradually let them grow another ground and divert. Do not take it negatively
Genuine thinking paradox -
We
The social context of perspective sharing
The feel good/weird/bad can create a new learning too. When I write something that meets what you care or hate or find weird, makes you remember it. Causes hormonal flow that I call hormonal traps
Hormonal Traps - can make you feel something. I call this feel theory.
Acknowledgement traps - Once you acknowledge the feeling, it starts processing that in the unconscious mind
Multiple thread trap - you think you can take many things
Limit of brain trap - You think the brain is limitless, it is only limitless when progressing a thought. In real actually it is weak and organic, low bandwidth, chemical dependent
SIngle state of action mind trap- In the surface(care state) it can only talk one thing at a time. You can think of multiple things step by step. But not all in the same time.
Use of Physics in human context
Uncertainty trap on not knowing what to do
Advanced social acting skill, observing, reacting and listening skill. A good act can make you feel good about something about a wrong thing
Perspective Sell trap - people only takes your perspective. They don’t usually hear or listen to what you say. You may not have a point or wrong.
Robot hang technique - like you can stop people by saying some terms they have no idea and you can bring up something out of spectrum and they will shut up and you may win even though you are totally
All can make us feel and immediately after feeling, we do acknowledge(or unacknowledge) and we
Perspective Trap - Because of that people may agree with a perspective, vibe, expressions etc but disagree with the words a person says. SInce they learn perspective and feel good, according to the feel good theory, we immediately acknowledge the thing we feel good about. According to acknowledgement theory, we start processing and learn it unconsciously. Now those wrong words that you didn’t like will stay on surface(care stage as a feel weird thing and it will start processing and rewiring the brain too until it makes that weird thing normal in the brain).
Repeating phase - would make that learning totally acknowlwegde as brain would go tired.
Larger than life things doesn’t work with intentions but with flows
