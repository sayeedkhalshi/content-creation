To make people believe in a control structure,

1. Make people believe beyond the structure where their logic can't connect. Example - make us believe be good and god will give you everything you don't have in this earth, so they accept their poor fate.
2. Make it so much that their logic will break, bacially their narratives that built themselves would have no ground.
3. Scare them.
