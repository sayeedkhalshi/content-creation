Making a genius follows the learning cycle of a genius. When handwriting is the the greatest tool make us develop thinking in a way. Then there is more like talking, talking in a scenario, practice etc. All are part of this cycle. A cycle is different for everyone. But they are actually the cycle of fulfilling reality pot. The cycle is the experiences a learner wants to have for that learning. It’s filling the reality pot. This is how a genuous is made by feeding his mind. There are experiences that already had been experienced cause the need to fill those gap. Same it also created the way of learning for the learner.It’s the Learning Love of a learner. So One is learning habit and another is the want of experience. But when someone gets stopped, they can’t function. It’s the learning trouble of a genius’s learning love.

When we write it creates a projection and let is think from that projection as an immediate philosophy. People who have great experience in any part of the genius cycle to fill the learning reality pot except learning doesn’t get as much space to create a better projection. A parameter of a genius is his projection ability, giving importance to the projection, to think based on the projection. This importance of projection creates better memory. Memories importance is the basic.

Intelligence is ability to use projection and intention to see things from many perspective in the spectrum of reality or society. Here memory is important and we don’t need to think about memory, it works as blood flows.
