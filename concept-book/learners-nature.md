Spontaneous - Where the learner let it happen as is
Learners Nature have two perspectives -
Logical
A genuine thought can’t have a logical expression exactly. A generalized expression from that thought may sound unethical in words but still can be called logical. Where logical is ethical.
Emotional/Hormonal
Unethical. (Logically unethical is emotional too)
If each word are a generalization, then technically it’s unethical
Knowledge are unethical. The theory is, knowledge works until it’s undiscovered by the receiver. Respect doesn’t last for the wise. You can make up stories about Fugazi and people will wonder. Many times we say wise things cause we want attention. If someone goes into the same territory as the wise men, he can criticize the wise men for not being right.
Nobody likes your words if your words doesn’t connect with each other. So you made up the story
Nobody likes it if your words can’t feel an association with listeners way of understanding. So stories are wonderful
Ethical
Emotional perspectives are hardly ethical. Logical should be considered as ethical.
