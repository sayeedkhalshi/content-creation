Learning System

A learning system is fundamentally a perspective engineering. It should allow people get information from the perspective they are desiring. Then it becomes not just a information system but a thought connecting system. It lets people go on their desired path by providing the topics. Each topics gets a new perspective from everyone learning so another person may find that easier if that's what he is looking for next. Cause human only learns perspective, information doesn’t matter to learning, the attached perspective to it. So information added with perspective is the expression form of knowledge, experience. When you build, when you learn, when you search you look for the information on the current perspective your mental state projecting. Now why this cause perspective makes us closest to the narrative or flow. It tries to synchronizes to that flow’s frequency or whatever. The best control structure is the one that is from the perspective of your need.
