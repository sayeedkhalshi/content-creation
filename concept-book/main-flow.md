There is a unconscious mind as big as everything and it acts like a god. It thinks all the time and does the greatest part of the processing. It’s perfectly build or works. It doesn’t make any mistake and to knows exactly what is your way in all possible way. Processes very uncious things that you don’t know. You feel like unconscious mind isn’t you. You scares of it. This scarcity makes unconscious mind act perfectly. The more you get scared, it gets better. But not too much to lose or break neural connections(does our brain breaks neuron connection). But anxiety does attacks that brain. It handles and processes anxiety perfectly over the time with couressness, by making the subconscious mind suffer. Conscious mind actually subconscious mind except we can act on it. That’s why anxiety is great and anxiety is the driver of learning, evolution(is deeper learning) process.
