Management is bigger than learning. The difference between other learner like the universe, changes, evolution etc is mostly we have a goal. Which is intention. Unable to fathom how to manage gives us the ultimate learning anxiety. Only meaningful thing in the world is relaxing. You can relax if you have all your things managed. This is where we fail. But to manage learning, we gotta know what it is, so we can manage how it is.

Management is managing our intention. So we know how to attempt and form our next learning.

Connection based learning - for some terms in learning path will not be connected to main goal directly. But our brain always try to see it from that perspective and couldn’t find any connection and gives up. Since we can’t tolerate to think of something we can’t think of. So we need to describe or draw connection to the goal. There should be a connection section. Each connection sample will have multiple example
