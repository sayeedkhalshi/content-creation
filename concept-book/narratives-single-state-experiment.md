In micro thinking, whatever people thinks, gives them feeling and they associate that thinking and feeling with the outcome. So next time they tr

We learn by emotions. Our desires are driven by emotions. If our emotions are from suffering of want of fit in, we learn to impress people with our social skills. But when we are talented in some topics and we use that talent to fit in and impress, we got two things.
We break the structure of social interactions with extra normal things. We mess up with our social skill because talent keeps growing and we can’t make everything understandable to people
We get extra benefit and we usually win cause it’s a plus point

The purpose is to find the building blocks of philosophy, understanding and creating learning process, a learning framework as same as our brain.

We learn by believing on the philosophy we get from a learning processing. We tend to believe on it so much because we have to hold on it to move on. If our beliefs in early stage gets shattered we can’t know what to hold on to learn the next one. We move by point to point. Not in a line but around or far point.

As a teacher two types of normal learners I found don’t work after first phase. One type of exceptional only cases work. Another exceptional case don’t even get what I tried to teach. It’s crazy yet so simple to see. So from my $$ research, I found 4 types of learners based on their ongoing mental state. Keep in mind, this isn’t a matter of iq or anything.

Extra care - each students had to be motivated in the situation of initial processing phase, when their plate is full

Scenario- you had to motivate, inspire them to learn a topic. They learn the initial phase from the teacher. Because the teacher could explain and the student could understand in their fresh mind.

Type1 - Could easily understand what I told. Let them study on their own, they could understand more and within a few days they can’t go anymore and has to take a break. They come back and felt they learned something. Then they could learn a few more. Until they hit a level where their personal beliefs of how to learn is challenged. Their old ideas wouldn’t work but they couldn’t let it go, they wouldn’t listen to me. So they would go with their own of learning and couldn’t progress anymore. Eventually they suffer and stops learning.

Type2 - Same as type 1 so far, except they know how to level up their learning techniques as required. But they wouldn’t keep relationship with me anymore, cause they thought they learned the missing pieces of what to learn from me. Their belief on self would come in the way to go on their own. Eventually they couldn’t figure out what to learn next, lack of inspiration and management wouldn’t let them go so far and they suffer and stop. They would ignore procesing time, taking breaks etc.They think they are better than teacher. Lanter, I found the solution, it is actually learning break up that making them do so, it is so emergency that in any how the brain would make them stop.

Type3 - Doesn’t understand much from the initial phase cause they live in a different mental state because of visible PTSD and distorted sense reality. They can have a low or high IQ, but the problem I see they can’t observe, perceive information because they can’t hold their mind observing micro informations in real time. They are in their head.

Type4 - Type 4 is the exceptional case. They are the one who doesn’t think of taking over the teacher. They are collaborative. They learn and keep the relationship both. Does everything as regarding. They are emotional, respective. The follow leaders, sometimes lead. All they want engagement on what they learn, share, listen. It’s pure only they want to learn because they want to do something bigger would leave the territory when learned enough to learn another.

Extra phase - So, I figured it’s the only person who learns and also doesn’t want to break relationships are the ones actually can learn something. To test among the learners, I created some extra test
Do only. Learn only what you need to do it. The reason is to have relationship with work. Since we have very bad relationship with learning. Learning has no initial benefit and because of lack of relationship with life we don’t love learning. We love only when we use it and see the fruit.
No one could believe, they could do things without knowing it. But when I showed just start and convert each doubt, insecurity, unknown to questions and search for the answer to them, they would be able to learn it. And they did things that they could never see doing for real.
To keep the relationship with me - message me for every new things learned, questions, doubt, enlightenments, triggers etc
No one could do it. They wouldn’t be able to message me even asked for two months with highest priority
To write stories about their learning to have relationship witht their learning.
Write each converted task as problems as problem means it has to be solved and it becomes close to life.
Manage activity - where they could write each problem as activity, each attempt to solve the problem and write review what they learned from the attempt. The reason is to have good relationship with self.
Review each others activity to keep relationships with each other

Result of extra phase - everyone would fail to do so. They wouldn’t do it.

Conclusion of extra phase- I figure there is a reason they aren’t able to do any of it.
They loved working, do things instead of just plain learning. But it was hard to make them believe so
They don’t feel keeping relationship with each other or teacher is important. They don’t feel the eternal relationship is required
Most have them have attachment issues yet none of them wants to have attachment with the anyone or teachers
No one trust each other. None relationships has been build among them.
They can’t get emotionally invested or attached to write stories about their learnings
They can convert tasks as problems as problem means anxiety and PTSD
They can manage their activity as they don’t have
They don’t ever like reviewing or commenting each others activity. They never felt they has to keep relationships with each other.
This is where I developed the idea of narrative and single state of mind, otherwise why couldn’t they do with their intentions.

Why do you feel not to look at another resource of a topic that you just learned. What I mean you don’t feel like learning more from the moment you are enlightened with new informations. Information that triggered yourself. Because your mind just started processing it and in that thread, it can’t take more information. Trying to consume more will be hard and trying hard may not let you process it to form/support all your desire. Desire means, you process a information as long as your desire of things haven’t processed. Sounds confusing, right? So this desire means you can’t control the learning process until the desire is finish. What exactly is this desire? This desires are twenty different things of primary subjects you wanted to master. This desires can be small tiny topics you wanted to learn.You obviously got triggered because it matches some patterns in some topic. Now your brain wants to process it. Before the process you want to look for if more of your desired subjects can be enlightened with it. Or maybe a new subject too. But you can’t really find a way to fulfil that desire of checking all the subjects. At some points you don’t want to look at anymore to those topics and you are overwhelmed. This desire is built overtime. It’s a very primary flow of a human brain and that follow is usually beyond we seems to control. Ambitious (learning) means you got a lot of desire and your learning process is hard and tough. You gotta process a lot, wait a lot, look at the topics a lot when you are enlightened. You might want to experience and reality check your learnings too. So the chart of you consuming information to the enlightenment and taking a break to process it has to be organic and normal, should follow usual waves. This chart and waves that tells you its a flow going forward. The high, low and consolidations should complement each other. High means learning, low means taking break and consolidation means you are experiencing it in life.

There is a range of spectrum of desire and beyond spectrum human mind can create desire that creates flow which can be unusual and this is the core of psychological disorder. Usually to keep the learning and decision making flow not crashed (this is to keep godly, logical mind intact and the anxiety to not destroy/expose the godly mind), to survive we create desires that can be unusual. Can drive to process and experience learning to satisfy desires in those unusual topics. When a person doesn[t understand what are the desires they are creating in another person is usually a abuser. Its not a judgment though. A definition. Abusers are also struggling tomind
