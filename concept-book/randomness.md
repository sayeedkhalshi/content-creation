The universe works in randomness. But randomness is defined by stableness. Stable things that changes very little and changes slowly. Thus evolution happens slowly.

Every situation is a random situation. If one situation has a solution then each situation has a solution too. But whoever finds the most normal situation becomes the leader. simplest solution without loss but benefit is a normal situation. Since everything you do is wrong, you do whatever, then you make use of that thing to a great cause. Cause in randomness we have infinite amount of great cause to make use of our wrong doing. We can never plan anything. Cause everytime we plan, it’s a acknowledgement, every acknowledgement leads to a release and relief and rest and to look out for new things. Such way, you can’t plan but just do. But if you can manipulate your intention, you can make use of your wrong doing more easily accessible cause than harder ones.

Every genuine thinking we have basically our thoughts to find the solution to a problem. If not we will not think about it. Our thought generations are logical in the sense of need. Neither we would share it. But we share it because of our learning pride, finding a new flow, celebrating new, being better, learning pride
