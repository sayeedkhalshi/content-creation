There are two states of learning - (we know conscious, subconscious, unconscious. But i will say)
Controlled - Where the learner and hormone are trying to control the process and outcome of learning.
Everyone is logical. We do because we decide too - learner controlled
We do even we donâ€™t decide - hormonal controlled
Spontaneous - Where the learner let it happen as is
