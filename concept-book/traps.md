The uncertain effect/trap - uncertainty makes someone look
The Genious Trap - when you think knowing the most normal thing is real and knowing that is genius. But it can be any other way too
There is no closer. It’s shallow. Whatever you do or get or achieved, it never reaches anywhere you are in the same place. It’s the normal flow that always stays on - The Normal Flow. When this flow gets ruined you get sick

This book is a philosophy and philosophies are filled with traps. Philosophies can be divided into small pieces of logic. Logics can be different for each perspective and flows. The audience has their own way of seeing things that are made of their own logic, perspective, and flow. To acknowledge all the differences we have to acknowledge that the logics and philosophies are traps that we believe in. We can call them a belief trap or philosophical trap. But I will call them learning traps. I will see them from the learning perspective in a flow of debunking them into pieces with the intention of solving our learning problems in the hope of a hormonal reward of achievement or failure to do so. Hormonal reward is hormonal slavery. Confidence makes the hormonal reward makes learning stronger thus hard to overcome the flows build upon those learnings

Another reason we can’t be sure of things because probability is in the depth of this universe. In micro level just a little change becomes a different thing in macro level.

In the beginning our brains would have a personality(mentality) that would include a lot of point of views. It would have a lot of point of views to accept(agree or disagree to accept) and process informations. It would have a structure or a framework that defies initial character. Points of view is the most important part in human learning process. When we learn we learn 3 things 1. How we learn/ the process - that are predefined and same for each. It efficiency and strength varies because of its physical structure and very little influenced by it’s personality structure. Unconscious 2. How we accept or point of view - personality structure. 1. Subconscious - we can understand if we look into those process 2. Conscious - We can analyse / understand the process real time. 3. What we learn - ‘what we learn’ can update our ‘how we accept or point of view’. But not usually the process

way we learn -
Intent to change - When you hear > learn. When you have a habit to change when you hear, you can't handle people saying umwanted things. A normal is you control what you change and regulate change of hearing.
By increasing physical limit of brain or pushing it to limit
Or by reality information model building
By escaping, Rest or long term rest, rule is - escape from anything serious, keep intent to change, for long term and build better learning philosophy
Biggest problem of learning —> force learnning, leatning anxiety, reality gaps, too lesz rewards - only doing it as a real project gives rewards or we need tov recognize learning as a doing, hormone enslaving or addiction
Confident that makes us learn strongly. A confidence in learning creates strong bond in neurons. Confidence learning creates better flow than usual
Intention of confident
Real confident
Problem
Identifying emotions, the source/cause of our actions

First, clean the concept and misconception of learning
Thinking = Flow —> character —> plan > prediction > decision > do in a flow
Thinking → Feeling —> internal reaction —> outer begaviour
The nature of thinking is influenced by flow.
Learning Trap: Logics are our learnings. I call them Learning Philosophy. Generating logic is Learning Processing. Making of Learning Philosophy can be influenced by all the learning traps
If people doesn’t hold their emotions because of insecurity, what would happen. How freely people would share their emotions and expressions. If people were to show their emotions and be confident about it. What I have seen the most intelligent people on earth shows a lot of expressions that other people wouldn’t dare to share. Does that mean if you let your kid show more emotions they would be more
Locked on a flow or hormonal flow is a psychiatric disorder
Mental State Fluidity determines the feeling
The Intentional Trap of Possible Healing - We hurt ourselves if we know there is a solution to heal just for the sake of our curiosity
Unacknowledgment Trap
Laws
You see and feel but don’t acknowledge
Only after acknowledgment, your brain can think of it from a clear perspective
Unacknowledge stops brain processing certain learning
Acknowledgment Trap
You accept points of view after you acknowledge something
Example - I can say wrong things. But if you acknowledging it, you will think it’s true. Because our flow of character determines what we decide. Not logic.
Hormonal Trap -
Hormonal flow creates our character flow. We call our flows - emotions. But calling that emotions only makes things more ambiguous.
Theory of acknowledgment
Kindness is anxiety - acknowledgment is the word
Making someoneacknowledge your issue,
Intentional Trap - We intentionally do wrong things but still do not violate the law of happy mode. That is because there is a also a happy outcome. That is unconscious. It maybe called procrastinating. But I better not attach old words to new kind of thinking that I am doing
Maybe Trap -
Acknowledging is an emotional situation, which is the overwhelming situation where we lie without knowing by saying the maybe truth.

Characteristic Trap
Intention Trap - intentions that make into the flow
Flow trap - flows that control our character makes our character
Hormonal Trap - we are a slave of hormones. Hormones are good. No need to feel a threat trap.
Emotional trap - when you take your emotions to define perspective, you are losing a lot of info
Deep dive trap - You don’t need to dive deep. Don’t have to know a lot about a term. Our brain figures out things (generalizes) on its own. If you keep getting other people’s knowledge and deep down into it, it wouldn’t work. It wouldn’t work much if you were deep down in your thoughts. That deep diving sounds essential but you may don’t need it most of the time.
Threat trap - we do things unnecessarily because we feel threatened
The overwhelming trap of
information,
emotions,

Bias Trap
Cultural Trap
Scientific Trap
Religious Trap
Feel bad trap, to give importance to a learning, when you don’t know a lot about it but want to know it a lot, when it’s emergency need, the brain must give it association with force learning anxiety to give it importance, otherwise the main flow running a narrative wouldn’t learn it cause it’s too dissociative. Eventually it’s a learning technique
Limitation trap of brain. We feel like we can take a lot but no.
Hormone trap:- when you want to say something to change someones mind, you feel like what do I do. How to understand her/him. Well nothing to, you just do something that releases hormone towards what you want. No complexity or maze. Its rather opposite. There is not much to find out. Its just hormone

    Unacknowledgment Trap: All the things that we see, we know, we understand, but we don’t point them out. We don’t have the time to put some effort and fix our inner thoughts cause we are running in a flow. Just because we didn’t give it some time to clear our minds, we don’t acknowledge the outcome. But if someone points it out, we say

Oh, that’s not true - because you have a forceful nature of putting intentions over understanding. Which is the intention trap.
Oh, I knew it was like that - De ja vu you actually had this genuine thought
Oh I didn’t think about it this way - Cause you forgot, skipped, missed, or ignored the genuine thought
Intentional

We are bad at communication. People need to express themselves. We need to know each other’s inner thoughts. Understand our character, story, and perspective. Need to understand how others react based on their thoughts and learnings. We need to criticize inner thoughts. Thoughts are not beliefs. They are opinions and worth arguing. We learn ourselves and we learn others. Like a skill grows in you. Learning grows in you. This means, all the learnings are skill development. That can be a collective human species’ superpower skill. I want to give meaning to the science of understanding and learning. A perspective that people can understand. So you can associate those big words with you. From a perspective, like a story that connects with you.

We live in many learning boxes. But mostly in the cultural learning box, scientific learning box, and religious learning box. Our personal learnings and thoughts are the implied teaching from them. This means we are manipulated but we are in an acknowledgment trap. We don’t just acknowledge them on a personal level. But not on a cultural level if something isn’t acknowledged it means the problem stays. Something can’t be said but implied is easily taught. The Learning Implication Theory says, people wouldn’t listen to you but your attitude.
