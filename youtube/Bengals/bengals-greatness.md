no lets be real here. tell the truth. didn't we build many best thing on earth?

1. Panther panchali - the greatest film on eart, can you even debate?
2. Rabindra Sangeet - there is no other thing on earth like that, it's a standalone thing along with nazrul.
3. Nazrul Sangeet - you will never see wording so beautiful and metaphors so melodical
4. Sarath's Novel - No one has ever shown the society like Sarath, no onw on earth, not even homer, but yes not philosophically rich, but that's not the point. Because west was unreachable, we had no cohesion with other civilization until now because of distance, what we did we did our own.
5. Muslin, Jamdani - anyway comparable with any???
6. People - who can't be manipulated and synchronized through everyday debates
7. Food, 6 out of top 10 foods in nutrient are everyday food in bd
8. Highly immune people, hard worker, high testorone, high production rate of child, even without moder medicine, people could have 10+ children
9. Fighter, we never let anyone control us. We say it on the face, we don't let the govt dominate.
10. Manipulation proof, deep state failed brainwashing us
11. Our land is fertile like no other, statistically.
12. We ruled india after the mughals and dhaka, murshidabad was the capital
13. We seek for truth so much that sufi's could teach us Islam and we would convert by logic, not emotional attachment to false religions. Unlike North India where Islam came through conquest, Islam in Bengal came mostly through Sufis, traders, and saints. People were drawn to the simplicity and equality in Islam compared to caste rules. That’s why Bengal became one of the largest Muslim populations in the world without a violent takeover.
14. See our people how they support sports for argentina and brazil would tell how Bengalis are built different.
15. We bypassed state provided patriarchy education system by skipping school and going to private tutors similar to old days when people were going to wise men's ashram, totally safe from propaganda's, govt tried to block it a lot but failed.
16. “The men of Gangaridai and Prasii were said to be awaiting him with an army of 80,000 horsemen, 200,000 footmen, 8,000 chariots, and 6,000 fighting elephants.”Bengal didn’t scare Alexander directly on the battlefield — it scared him through reputation and the mutiny of his weary army. But that reputation was so strong that it literally turned back the most ambitious conquest in history.
17. Bengal was the world’s largest supplier of war elephants.
18. Arab traders (9th–10th century) wrote Bengal was so rich in rice, textiles, and ships that “it seemed like paradise.”

19. Later Europeans (Portuguese, Dutch, British) called Bengal the “richest province in the world.”

20. The Mongols (13th century) destroyed Baghdad, crushed Delhi many times. But they never entered Bengal. The marshes, rivers, and heavy rainfall made cavalry warfare impossible for steppe nomads. Bengal remained safe while the rest of Asia was burning.

21. Chinese never attacked
22. Between the 14th–16th centuries, the Bengal Sultanate was among the richest states in the world. They exported cotton, silk, saltpeter, rice, and ships.
23. Wari-Bateshwar (in present-day Bangladesh) is an archaeological site older than 2,500 years.

24. Under the Pala dynasty (8th–12th century CE), Bengal was the center of Buddhism in the world. The Palas built Nalanda, Vikramashila, Somapura Mahavihara (Paharpur, Bangladesh) — the “Harvards” of their time. These universities had thousands of monks and scholars, attracting students from Tibet, Nepal, China, and Southeast Asia. After Tibetan Buddhism was established, it spread further east to China and Mongolia.

Now be real. anyone like us?
